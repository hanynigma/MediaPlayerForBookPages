Android Open Source Application : MediaPlayer with Book Pages

welcome,
I am a novice in programming Android applications so I hope for forgiveness of any errors or that the code is not sufficiently organized, I have done the best I can and I hope those who can help in revising the code or improving it will be generous to develop the code and send feedback
Thanks in advance


Application idea:
This code is all from my development, its function is to play an audio file with an image of a page from a book or other images

ListView is used with Arrays to display images and sound files

Media Player
Can play audio files independently
And all the functions you need:
Mute
Forward
play
Stop
reward
back 10 sec
forward 10 sec
next audio
previos audio
ampilifire
When the current file ends, it automatically moves to the next file, even if it reaches the last file, it starts over with the first file

Voice Up
Voice Down
